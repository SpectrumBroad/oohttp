## [Unreleased][]
Nothing notable at the moment.

## [1.1.0][]
### Added
-   `toFunction`, `toFunctionArray` and `toFunctionMap` methods to pass individual results through a function. These behave much like `toObject` and such, but instead of passing the results to a constructor, they are passed to a function.

-   Support for `basic` proxy authorization.
